# SCT_DS_01 — CensusIndia Insights

## Objective
The objective of this task is to analyze Indian census data to understand population distribution and demographic patterns across different regions of India using data analysis and visualization techniques.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Indian Census Dataset
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains region-wise demographic information such as population counts, gender distribution, and other census-related attributes.  
  Each row represents a geographic region, and each column represents a demographic feature.

---

## Project Workflow
1. Loaded the census dataset using Pandas
2. Inspected data structure and column information
3. Checked for missing values and data consistency
4. Performed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
5. Analyzed population distribution across regions
6. Visualized demographic patterns using charts and graphs

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory analysis was conducted to understand how population and demographic features vary across different regions. Visualizations helped in identifying population concentration patterns and regional differences.

---

## Key Insights
- Population distribution varies significantly across regions
- Certain regions have higher population concentration
- Demographic data can reveal meaningful regional patterns
- Census data is valuable for data-driven policy and planning decisions

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Conclusion
This task provided hands-on experience with real-world census data and strengthened foundational skills in data loading, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization. The analysis demonstrates how demographic data can be used to derive meaningful insights at a regional level.
